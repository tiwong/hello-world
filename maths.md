<!--- <p>I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune; previously at the Max Planck Institut für Mathematik (MPIM), Bonn. My work focuses on the interplay between trace formulae and L-functions in the theory of automorphic forms and representation theory. I also like to think about interactions between homotopy theory and number theory.</p> --->

### Some past teaching:

I organized the <a href="langlands">Langlands Program Seminar</a> at the CUNY GC from 2014–2016. Find the notes <a href="Langlands learning notes.pdf">here</a>.

- <i>Fall 2018: Stochastic Processes - IISER Pune</i>

  This course assumes a background in measure theoretic probability. We develop the basics of continuous martingales, then move on to Brownian motion, which sets the stage for stochastic integration, or Itô calculus. We then develop the theory of stochastic differential equations, and discuss applications to PDEs and also mathematical finance. Find the notes <a href="426Notes.pdf">here</a>.


- <i>Spring 2016: Topics in Geometry - Vassar College</i>

  The first half of the course introduces Galois theory through famous problems in geometry; the second half of the course hints at modular forms through the problem of sums of squares, from Fermat to Jacobi.  Find the notes <a href="231Notes.pdf">here</a>.


- <i>Fall 2012: Thinking Mathematically - Brooklyn College</i>

  The first half of the course develops mathematical thinking in the sense of logic and proof; the second half of the course approaches social justice through matehmatical tools, considering how numbers can be used and misused. Text: <em>Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers</em>, Eric Gutstein and Bob Peterson Eds., 2013
