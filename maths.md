> “A mathematician is a person who primarily studies mathematics. They usually study a variety of mathematics in their undergraduate studies before proceeding to study more specific topics.”

Here's the maths page!
  
<p>I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune; previously at the Max Planck Institut für Mathematik (MPIM), Bonn. My work focuses on the interplay between trace formulae and L-functions in the theory of automorphic forms and representation theory. I also like to think about interactions between homotopy theory and number theory.</p>

### In progress

1. From binary Hermitian forms to Bianchi modular forms (with C. Karabulut and D. Zagier).

2. Eisenstein cocycles over imaginary quadratic fields II: p-adic L-functions (with J. Flórez and C. Karabulut).

3. The balanced Voronoi formula for GL(*n,F*) (with G. Cherubini).

### Papers

I organized the <a href="langlands">Langlands Program Seminar</a> at the CUNY GC. Find the notes <a href="Langlands learning notes.pdf">here</a>.

### Some interesting courses I've taught:


- <i>Spring 2016: Topics in Geometry - Vassar College</i>

  The first half of the course introduces Galois theory through famous problems in geometry; the second half of the course hints at modular forms through the problem of sums of squares, from Fermat to Jacobi.  Find the notes <a href="231Notes.pdf">here</a>.


- <i>Fall 2012: Thinking Mathematically - Brooklyn College</i>

  The first half of the course develops mathematical thinking in the sense of logic and proof; the second half of the course approaches social justice through matehmatical tools, considering how numbers can be used and misused.
