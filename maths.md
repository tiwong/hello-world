<p>I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute, Bonn. My work focuses on the interplay between trace formulae and L-functions in the theory of automorphic forms. I also like to think about interactions between homotopy theory and number theory.</p>

### Papers 

1. Eisenstein cocycles on GL(n) and special values of L-functions in imaginary quadratic fields (with Florez and Karabulut) Preprint  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08565">arXiv</a>

2. On smoothing singularities of elliptic orbital integrals on GL(n) and Beyond Endoscopy (with O.E. Gonzalez, C.H. Kwan, S.J. Miller, R. Van Peski) Submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05938">arXiv</a>

3. Lower bounds for Weil's Explicit Formula via Selberg's Trace Formula. Submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02296">arXiv</a>

### Some loose ends:

- An idea on connecting Bernstein's 'Stacks in Representation Theory' to infinity categories. [Slides](BeamerNUS.pdf), [PDF](AHT.pdf). 

- An attempt to formulate the tensor product lift of GL(n) x GL(m) representations in terms of the Hitchin fibration <a href="Tensor products.pdf">PDF</a>

- Generalizing work of Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel, on bilinear sums at AWS 2016. (with S. Chow, A. Gafni, D. Lowry-Duda, and T. Mao) <a href="BilinearSamv1.pdf">PDF</a>

- An attempt to formulate the notion of a multiplicative genus for Levine's algebraic cobordism. (with E. Elmanto) <a href="A1Genus.pdf">PDF</a>

- Problem session at Sarnak 61 conference – I was a scribe for the problem session held at Peter Sarnak’s 61st birthday conference. <a href="SarnakSession.pdf">PDF</a>


I organized the <a href="langlands">Langlands Program Seminar</a> at the CUNY GC. Find the notes <a href="Langlands learning notes.pdf">here</a>.

### Some interesting courses I've taught:


- <i>Spring 2016: Topics in Geometry - Vassar College</i>

  The first half of the course introduces Galois theory through famous problems in geometry; the second half of the course hints at modular forms through the problem of sums of squares, from Fermat to Jacobi.  Find the notes <a href="231Notes.pdf">here</a>.


- <i>Fall 2012: Thinking Mathematically - Brooklyn College</i>

  The first half of the course develops mathematical thinking in the sense of logic and proof; the second half of the course approaches social justice through matehmatical tools, considering how numbers can be used and misused.
