This is an expanded version of the general audience talk I gave at the Science on Tap--formerly known as Drunk on Science, which is much cooler but probably less professional--in Pune, with craft beer sponsored by Great State Ale Works!

Okay. So let's talk about numbers. They're everywhere around us; from the statistics that are served to us, to the many algorithms that mediate our technological lives, more and more they influence our lives without our knowing. Of course, numbers by themselves seem innocent enough. Especially as a pure mathematician, I can readily say that mathematicians like to think—wrongly, of course—that the mathematics they pursue is a about beauty and truth, and has little bearing on society. In this series of posts, we'll look at various ways this rosy view of mathematics is patently false, that instead the pursuit of mathematics pure and applied is deeply entangled in worldly affairs.

More to the point, we'll talk about how numbers can be used for evil. Numbers are used to represent, rather the way photographs are. Now, the first obvious misuse is when the numbers are doctored, like how a photograph might be edited and distorted by Photoshop; or secondly, and less obvious, is when the numbers are accurate but don't capture the whole picture, as it could literally happen with photographs. In each case, the representation is used to advance a predetermined agenda, at the expense of truth.

> 'There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics.'

In this first post, we'll warm up by starting before the age of the personal computer, and talk about statistics. Most of this will be taken from the classic text 'How to lie with statistics' by Darrell Huff.

#### 1. Selection Bias

Sampling Bias

Cherry-picking data, discarding unfavorable data, loaded questions, placebo effect

#### 2. The Well-Chosen Average: 

This one is a pretty straightforward trick, and you've probably learned this once before in primary school. It's essentially the difference between mean, median or mode, each of which might be considered an 'average' value.

#### 3. The Little Figures That Are Not There

degree of significance, Gesell's norms, graph labels

#### 4. Much Ado about Practically Nothing: probable error and standard error

Central Limit Theorem

#### 5. The Gee-Whiz Graph: scale and range of graph

#### 6. Misleading graphics

The One-Dimensional Picture: proportion of pictorials

#### 7. The Semiattached Figure: false representation

#### 8. Causation and correlation

This last one is pretty well-known, so I'll just point to a few fun examples: An entertaining collection of graphs showing [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/552/), and an actually published paper on ['The Effect of Country Music on Suicide'](http://comp.uark.edu/~ches/CountryMusic_Suicide.pdf) (Sack and Gundlach, 1992), that suicide rates among white people increased with the amount of airtime dedicated to country music. The reported (but not interpreted) correlation was a whopping r = 0.54.

#### Last thoughts

How to Statisticulate: percent, percentage points, percentile. decimal numbers

Finally, as a handy guide to readers, Huff gives us some pointers on `how to talk back to a statistic', with a set of five questions, when faced with a statistic: 

- Who says so?
- How do they know?
- Did they change the subject?
- Does it make sense? 

So we've seen what sort of trickery can be done even without the use of very much technology. Next we'll take a look at what happens when you throw in computers and the internet into the mix. On to Part 2!
