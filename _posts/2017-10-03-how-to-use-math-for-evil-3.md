*This is an expanded version of the general audience talk I'm giving at the Science on Tap--formerly known as Drunk on Science, which is much cooler but probably less professional--in Pune, the brainchild of the illustrious Anoop Mahajan, with craft beer sponsored by Great State Ale Works! See [Part 1](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/28/how-to-use-math-for-evil-1.html), [Part 2](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/30/how-to-use-math-for-evil-2.html), [Part 3](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/03/how-to-use-math-for-evil-3.html), [Part 4](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/06/how-to-use-math-for-evil-4.html)*

Last time we entered into world of Big Data, and saw how complicated algorithms extend into our daily lives. We ended on the fact that Big Data is contingent upon data mining, which drills deeper and deeper into our lives. This time, we'll talk about surveillance and cryptosystems, that are intertwined with this process. Surveillance, is basically 

#### Death by algorithm

Before we get started, let's note that mathematics has been used in warfare from ages past. Trigonometry and calculus have helped to calculate trajectories of rockets and bullets, a study known as [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics). If you watch shows like CSI, this is also involved in forensics, like with blood-splatter analysis. 

And in keeping with the theme from Part 2, Obama's so-called presidential kill list, formally known as the [Disposition Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix), that governs drone strikes in the Middle East and Africa in fact involves complicated algorithms like the NSA's [Skynet program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKYNET_(surveillance_program)) (not the the one in Terminator!) applies machine learning to communications data, in order to identify possible terror suspects. A terror suspect is then assigned certain scores like a player on a baseball card, and this ranks them in the kill list, which in turn determines drone strikes. [In the words](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/21/death-from-above-nia-csa-skynet-algorithm-drones-pakistan) of former CIA and NSA director General Michael Hayden himself, 

> "We kill people based on metadata."

He later qualified his statement that the US government only kills foreigners, not US citizens this way. But even if you were a US citizen, you certainly have reason to worry. As mentioned in the last post, US warfare tactics abroad do find their way back home. Good examples are the counterinsurgency measures used at police-brutality protests like [in Ferguson and Baltimore](https://gizmodo.com/welcome-to-the-new-age-of-counterinsurgency-policing-1702621152),  and counterterrorism tactics used at the [Dakota Access Pipeline protest](https://theintercept.com/2017/05/27/leaked-documents-reveal-security-firms-counterterrorism-tactics-at-standing-rock-to-defeat-pipeline-insurgencies/) at Standing Rock. Not to mention the fact that the militarisation of US police force is a direct outcome of government policy like the 1997 [1033 program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program) and [more recent presidential orders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/donald-trump-news-police-military-style-weapons-vehicles), giving surplus military equipment to civilian law enforcement services.

#### Encryption

The advent of quantum mechanics, what one might think of as [blue-sky research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research), that is, research with no immediate 'real-world' applications, also came hand in hand in nuclear fission, as with the infamous [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project). The same has happened for number theory, which the famous mathematician Gauss called the Queen of Mathematics. Number theory is the study of prime numbers, the building blocks of integers. It is also the foundation for modern cryptosystems, or encryption methods. They do good things, like protect your credit card purchase on Amazon from being hacked and keep your bank accounts secure, but they also are at the epicentre of issues surrounding surveillance, security, and privacy.

The basic idea of encryption is simple: Ann wants to tell Bob a secret, and if Eve gets a hold of the message, the message would read like gibberish. To do this, Ann must encrypt the message in a way that only Bob can decipher.

Let's look at a basic method, known as public key encryption.
