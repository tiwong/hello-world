*This is an expanded version of the general audience talk I'm giving at the Science on Tap--formerly known as Drunk on Science, which is much cooler but probably less professional--in Pune, the brainchild of the illustrious Anoop Mahajan, with craft beer sponsored by Great State Ale Works! See [Part 1](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/28/how-to-use-math-for-evil-1.html), [Part 2](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/30/how-to-use-math-for-evil-2.html), [Part 3](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/03/how-to-use-math-for-evil-3.html), [Part 4](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/06/how-to-use-math-for-evil-4.html)*

Last time we entered into world of Big Data, and saw how complicated algorithms extend into our daily lives. We ended on the fact that Big Data is contingent upon data mining, which drills deeper and deeper into our lives. This time, we'll talk about surveillance and cryptosystems, that are intertwined with this process.

Before we get started, let's note that mathematics has been used in warfare from ages past. Trigonometry and calculus have helped to calculate trajectories of rockets and bullets, a study known as [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics). If you watch shows like CSI, this is also involved in forensics, like with blood-splatter analysis. 

The advent of quantum mechanics, what one might think of as [blue-sky research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research), that is, research with no immediate 'real-world' applications, also came hand in hand in nuclear fission, as with the infamous [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project). The same has happened for number theory, which the famous mathematician Gauss called the Queen of Mathematics. Number theory is the study of prime numbers, the building blocks of integers. It is also the foundation for modern cryptosystems, or encryption methods.

#### Public-key encryption

Let's look at a toy model of a very basic model, known as the RSA public key. 

#### Drone algorithms
