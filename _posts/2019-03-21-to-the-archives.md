Did you know Asian American liberation theology was a thing in the past? Well, it was. Alongside Black liberation theology, Latin American liberation theology, and white feminist liberation theology. What's left of it is hidden in dusty archives, most of it in the [Graduate Theological Union archives](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt75804087/entire_text/). 

First up: [*Amerasian Theology of Liberation* (1976)](/files/SanoReader1973.pdf) Digitised thanks to D. Stiver at the GTU, and the [*The Theologies of Asian Americans and Pacific Peoples: A Reader* (1976)](/files/SanoReader1976.pdf) (warning: 62 MB!) uploaded with permission of compiler Bishop Roy I. Sano. Digitised by yours truly, with thanks to the Vancouver School of Theology.

For some context, check out the [*Roots: Asian American Movements in Los Angeles*](http://camla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CAM-Roots-Zine-2017.pdf) zine accompanying the "Roots: Asian American Movements 1968-80s" exhibit at the Chinese American Musuem, LA in 2017. The name harkens to the out of print 1971 *Roots: An Asian American Reader* edited by Amy Tachiki. Also, the revolutionary newspaper-magazine [*Gidra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gidra_(newspaper)) from 1969 to 1974 is available at the [Densho Digital Repository](http://ddr.densho.org/ddr/densho/297/).
