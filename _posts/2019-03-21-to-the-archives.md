Did you know Asian American liberation theology was a thing in the past? Well, it was. Alongside Black liberation theology, Latin American liberation theology, and white feminist liberation theology. What's left of it is hidden in dusty archives, most of it in the [Graduate Theological Union archives](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt75804087/entire_text/). The second reader is digitsed by myself, with thanks to the Vancouver School of Theology, and the rest are thanks to D. Stiver at the GTU, posted with permission of Roy I. Sano.

- [Autobiographical Reflections for Amerasian Theology of Liberation (1973)](/files/SanoAutobiographical1973.pdf)
- [East Asian and Amerasian Liberation: Second Conference on East Asian and Amerasian Theology (1975)](/files/SanoProceedings1975)
- [The Theologies of Asian Americans and Pacific Peoples: A Reader (1976)](/files/SanoReader1976.pdf) (warning: 62 MB!)

For some context, check out the [*Roots: Asian American Movements in Los Angeles*](http://camla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CAM-Roots-Zine-2017.pdf) zine accompanying the "Roots: Asian American Movements 1968-80s" exhibit at the Chinese American Musuem, LA in 2017. The name harkens to the out of print 1971 *Roots: An Asian American Reader* edited by Amy Tachiki. Also, the revolutionary newspaper-magazine [*Gidra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gidra_(newspaper)) from 1969 to 1974 is available at the [Densho Digital Repository](http://ddr.densho.org/ddr/densho/297/). Some other books on the Asian American history of that era:

- *Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties,* Karen Ishizuka
- *Legacy to Liberation: Politics and Culture of Revolutionary Asian Pacific America,* Fred Ho (ed)

and for Asian American histories at large

- *American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders,* Gary Y. Okihiro
-  *Asian American Dreams: The Emergence of an American People*, Helen Zia 
- *Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans,* Ronald Takaki
