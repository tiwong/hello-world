I read somewhere, with regards to the Trump adminstration, that experts on authoritarianism warn that you should keep a list of the changes that are happening so as not to forget the way things were, that the new normal is *not* normal. The erosion of civil liberties is exactly that: a slow chipping away at your fundamental rights, so that by the time you realise what is happening, it is already too late.

There's a chance what's going on with climate change is already too late, but only time will tell. This page maintains a list of phenomena around the world, related to global warming or climate change, and will be continually updated.

As a scientist, I feel it's my duty encourage you to dig through to the original source when possible. Almost always, reporting about scientific progress is exaggerated and distorted. 

- 10/2017 [There's a climate bomb under your feet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-06/there-s-a-climate-change-bomb-under-your-feet). "What they found, published yesterday in the journal Science, may mean the accelerating catastrophe of global warming has been fueled in part by warm dirt. As the Earth heats up, microbes in the soil accelerate the breakdown of organic materials and move on to others that may have once been ignored, each time releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."

- 9/2017 [The great nutrient collapse](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511). “Every leaf and every grass blade on earth makes more and more sugars as CO2 levels keep rising. We are witnessing the greatest injection of carbohydrates into the biosphere in human history―[an] injection that dilutes other nutrients in our food supply.”

- 8/2017 [Wildfire in Greenland](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2017/08/10/roundtable-the-greenland-wildfire/). For over two weeks, 40 miles from the ice sheet. 

- 7/2017 [The Larsen C shelf](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/massive-iceberg-breaks-off-from-antarctica). A floating platform of glacial ice on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula, is the fourth largest ice shelf ringing Earth’s southernmost continent. In 2014, a crack that had been slowly growing into the ice shelf for decades suddenly started to spread northwards, creating the nascent iceberg. Now that the close to 2,240 square-mile (5,800 square kilometers) chunk of ice has broken away, the Larsen C shelf area has shrunk by approximately 10 percent.

- 10/2016 [Obituary: Great Barrier Reef](https://www.outsideonline.com/2112086/obituary-great-barrier-reef-25-million-bc-2016). "In 1981, the same year that UNESCO designated the reef a World Heritage Site and called it “the most impressive marine area in the world,” it experienced its first mass-bleaching incident. Corals derive their astonishing colors, and much of their nourishment, from symbiotic algae that live on their surfaces. The algae photosynthesize and make sugars, which the corals feed on. But when temperatures rise too high, the algae produce too much oxygen, which is toxic in high concentrations, and the corals must eject their algae to survive. Without the algae, the corals turn bone white and begin to starve. If water temperatures soon return to normal, the corals can recruit new algae and recover, but if not, they will die in months. In 1981, water temperatures soared, two-thirds of the coral in the inner portions of the reef bleached, and scientists began to suspect that climate change threatened coral reefs in ways that no marine park could prevent."

- 3/2010 [An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552.abstract). "One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record."
