*This is an expanded version of the general audience talk I'm giving at the Science on Tap--formerly known as Drunk on Science, which is much cooler but probably less professional--in Pune, the brainchild of the illustrious Anoop Mahajan, with craft beer sponsored by Great State Ale Works! See [Part 1](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/28/how-to-use-math-for-evil-1.html), [Part 2](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/09/30/how-to-use-math-for-evil-2.html), [Part 3](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/03/how-to-use-math-for-evil-3.html), [Part 4](https://tiwong.github.io/data/2017/10/06/how-to-use-math-for-evil-4.html)*

In this final part of the series, we'll look at how mathematics operates within academia. I won't be touching on this in the talk as it's more of a special interest topic; also this is possibly professionally risky as someone far away from being a tenured professor. But the issues raised below are highly pertinent today, and it's important to be aware of the waters we swim in.

#### An ethnography

What we'll look at in this post does not directly involve the content of pure, or even applied mathematics, but rather the culture of mathematics, and the power structures that support it.

#### Adjunctification

Ivory tower? Capitalism? Power structures? Social inequalities complicity
