    <h3 id="mapping-the-empire-a-database-of-injustice">Mapping the Empire: A database of injustice</h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Often in news reports, investigative journalism pieces, and various exposeés of injustices that occur at home and abroad, we take notice, shelve it in our minds, and then move on. Maybe at some point we feel a little outraged, become a little more aware, whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Now the idea here is to actually shelve that knowledge into a library that can be accessed and crowd-sourced. Its UI should be roughly the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an interactive geographical map with links to various infographics. We want this to be heavy on the infographics, because they are key to consolidating and conveying large amounts of data that we want to organize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should, if possible, be an option to observe events chronologically: One key issue is our tendency to be selective in the history we have learned, choose to learn, choose to ignore. Our mission is to bear witness to all these injustices past and present.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be research that backs up all claims: We must be rigorous and skeptical about our sources of data. From the outset we know that data is not neutral in the information that it gathers or ignores, we will be conscious of this inherent shortcoming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>There should be links to other resources, work that others have pioneered. Our aim is not to monopolize, but to consolidate in a maximally comprehensive way. For example,
    <ul>
      <li><a href="drones.pitchinteractive.com">Drones</a></li>
      <li><a href="fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/">Gun</a> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map">deaths</a></li>
      <li><a href="texasjusticeinitiative.org">Texas Justice Initiative</a></li>
      <li><a href="slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/06/animated_interactive_of_the_history_of_the_atlantic_slave_trade.html">Atlantic slave trade</a></li>
      <li><a href="sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/">Criminal justice facts</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/11/map-nuclear-bombs-power-weapons">Nuclear facilities in USA</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-is-the-assertion-and-map-that-Britain-has-invaded-all-but-22-countries-in-the-world">Countries invaded by Britain</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a catalogue, by which one can filter out the data by. To start with: drones, guns, domestic violence, mass incarceration, supply chain logistics, homelessness, environmental disasters, trafficking, slave labour, Monsanto, lynchings, genocide, protests, human rights violations, fast fashion, big anything, what else can you think of?</p>
  </li>
  <li>There should be a portion that highlights organizations and persons that are doing good work in these areas. (This might be a blog portion.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out this map, which I found later <a href="http://iamangelfoundation.org/black-eyed-peas-reunite-for-wheresthelove-campaign-against-violence/">link</a> which is powered by ArcGIS. Also, MotherJones has developed some rad <a href="https://github.com/motherjones/story-tools">open source tools</a> for their data-based journalism.</p>

<p>Who should benefit from this? For one, people like me who don’t know or keep forgetting, who want to see the big, big picture, even if it overwhelms you. One day it could be beneficial to researchers, policy makers, administrators, activists. Students could use it for research, and better yet, contribute to it by doing more research.</p>

<p>Eventually this should be a massive database, because of the nature of the project. But let’s start somewhere. Interested? Get in touch with me!</p>
